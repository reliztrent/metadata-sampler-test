<h2 id="search-results-sampled" class="clickable-header">Item record</h2>
<p>A JSON item record is one of the main types of records that the loc.gov API returns. You will get this type of response whenever you request a url that contains <code>/item/</code>, such as <code>https://www.loc.gov/item/jukebox-69817?fo=json</code>. This type of record contains the full metadata for digital object items, as well as additional metadata used to populate the item's web page (e.g., <code>https://www.loc.gov/item/jukebox-69817</code>). It also contains pointers to <code>resource</code> records that are children of the <code>item</code> record.</p>

<h2 id="search-results-sampled" class="clickable-header">Detailed field list</h2>
<p>Below is a table summarizing fields found across all of the collections in loc.gov. It only includes two parts of the <code>item</code> record: 
    <ul>
        <li><code>item</code></li>
        <li><code>resources</code></li>
    </ul>
<p>It doesn't include metadata fields from sections like <code>more_like_this</code>. <code>related_items</code>, and others.</p>
<p>This metadata list is based on sample of items fetched from each collection in loc.gov. Additional information about the data can be found in the <a href="#notes">notes</a> below. This list approximates the full list of data fields found in loc.gov item records. To view a sample record from a specific collection, use the drop down menu.</p>

<ol>
    <li>For each field, one sample was randomly selected from the first 100 results in each collection query record.</li>
    <li>All fields are from the <code>item</code> or <code>resources</code> section of the JSON record.</li>
    <li>Nested fields appear as in <code>resources &gt; 0 &gt; url</code>, where <code>resources</code> is dictionary key containing a list, <code>0</code> is the first item in that list, and <code>url</code> is a dictionary key within the list items.</li>
    <li>In cases where a field is nested under a list (such as the example above, where <code>url</code> is a field belonging to list items inside the <code>resources</code> field), samples have been pulled from the first list item but not from subsequent list items. As a result, you will not see <code>resources &gt; 1 &gt; url</code> in the table.</li> 
    <li>When the lowest level of the target field is a list, the sample value is pulled randomly from all items in the list.</li>
    <li>Where a field is listed in the table twice, one will be a list and the other will not. This means that the field appeared as a list in some collections but as a non-list in others.</li>
    <li>Where a field is listed as appearing in 0% of collections, this means that in all samples where the field appears, the field was present but empty.</li>
</ol>
